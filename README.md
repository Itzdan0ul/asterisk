# About archiving ðŸ“¦

<p align="justify">
  I have decided to migrate the project from Electron to Tauri, due to the advantages offered by the latter regarding the size of the application. Since it is a portable app, the final size that it ends up with when compiled with Electron is not what I am looking for.
